# IoT Hackathon

Welcome to the IoT Hackathon 2018.

## Goal
The goal of the event is to create a smart air quality sensor, together with a platform, which will collect and display information gathered by the sensor.
In order to successfuly complete the event each participating group needs to fulfill the following requirements:
- build and program a device with at least functional main sensor (PMS7003)
- add MQTT integration to the device (send data to MQTT server)
- build a platform capable of collecting and displaying data from MQTT server

## Process
Each team can designate sub-teams which will focus on device part and software part of the project.
Each sub-team **can** refer to one of the following pages for more information.  

- [DEVICE](./DEVICE.md)
- [PLATFORM](./PLATFORM.md)

## Good Luck
